# Machine-Learning-Support-Vector-Machine
# Introduction
Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a algorithm that every machine learning expert should
have in their arsenal. It is a great algorithim as it yileds
significant accuracy with less computational power. It can be used for both regression and classification tasks, though is widely used in
classification objectives. The objective of the support vector machine algorithm is to find a
hyperplane in an N-dimensional space (N — the number of features) that distinctly classifies
the data points. To separate the two classes of data points, there are many possible
hyperplanes that could be chosen. The objective of the algorithim is to find a plane that has the maximum
margin.

# Dataset
In this project we are going to use synthetic data provided in this repository. "X.csv” contains information pertaining to all the instances of the data set and “y.csv” has labels
pertaining to each instance in “X.csv”. For each instance, there are two attributes and a total of 100 instances.
